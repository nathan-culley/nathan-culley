- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nathan-culley! I'm a new developer working on strengthening my core skills and building a portfolio. I'm currently learning JavaScript through The Odin Project and am interested in full stack web development opportunities. Feel free to peruse my profile here or follow me on Twitter @nathan_culley.

I'm trying to commit at least once a day, every day in 2023. How am I doing?
